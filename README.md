# Simple Hull Resistance Estimator

This tool estimates calm-water resistance using empirical formulas like the Holtrop-Mennen method. It gives frictional and residual resistance components and plots resistance vs speed for typical hulls.

### Features
- Takes basic ship inputs (Lpp, B, T, S)
- Calculates Reynolds number, frictional and residual resistance
- Outputs a resistance vs speed plot
- Lightweight and runs on any machine

### How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
